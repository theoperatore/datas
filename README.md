# Datas

A small server / app to hold some api integrations so I can build otherstuff without having to always also build the 3rd-party integrations. First will be [GiantBomb's Game Api](https://giantbomb.com/api) for getting a random game.

Next.js project with Typescript and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
